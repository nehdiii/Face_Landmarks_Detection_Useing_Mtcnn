# Face_Landmarks_Detection_Useing_Mtcnn

Face detection is the task of detecting all human faces on a given image. This is typically done through extracting a list of bounding boxes, i.e. coordinates of smallest possible rectangles around faces 
i did that with mtcnn and the good thing of this model can get both bounding box and landmarks of face hope you enjoy reading the notebook
